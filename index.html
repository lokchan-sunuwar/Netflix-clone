                      Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of

                      on thousands of internet-connected devices. You can watch as
                      much as you want, whenever you want without a single
                      commercial-all for one low monthly price. There's always
                      something new to discover and new TV shows and movies are added
                      every week

                    The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to
                    give parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows
                    and movies in their own space. Kids profiles come with
                    PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict the
                    maturity rating of content kids can watch and block specific
                    titles you don't want kids to see.
